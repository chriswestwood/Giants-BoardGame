"Giants" is a board game released in 2008, published by Matagot. The theme revolves around the golden age of Easter Island, and the erecting of the famous Moa√Øs. You take control of one of the 5 clans, competing against each other to build and transport the giant statues to the platforms scattered around the coastline.

### TODO

- Include player turns. Helpful to know whos turn it is and who is still in the round.
