You take control of one of the 5 clans, competing against each other to build and transport the giant statues to the platforms scattered around the coastline.

- Included rulebook

### TODO

- Include player turns. Helpful to know whos turn it is and who is still in the round.

- Automate board clearing. On turn end pieces go back to original player for next round, an automated process will decrease wasted time moving pieces and less likely to miss a token.
